## Hi there!

My name's Khai, and I'm a Database and API Developer as well as a current student at Pomona College. I specifically specialize in backend engineering, setting up data pipelines and warehouses for LLM's, cloud deployment, and developing databases as well as REST APIs.

I'm currently studying Computer Science and Mathematics, and working as a data scientist at Pomona's advancement center, as well as an Backend Developer at ITS. Below, you'll find the current projects I'm working, what languages I'm most comfortable in, and more!

[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=python,pytorch,flask,anaconda,postgres,docker,aws&perline=6)](https://skillicons.dev)

Created a massive data pipeline, processing raw data from Spotify to extract features from popular songs. These previews are later used by weighted embeddings to rank the songs based on similarity, and are all stored using in a vector database using pgvector and PostgreSQL. The Flask API connected to this database, which is stored on AWS using RDS, is contained and processed through AWS Lambda, ECS, Batch, and S3.

Building a data pipeline and REST API to collect reviews and foods at dining halls using Spring and Postgres. Frontend is built with JS and React to process student reviews. Deploying database to AWS using Docker, AWS RDS, Lambda, S3, and ECS, then deploying frontend to Vercel.

### Chess Positions for Beginners

[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=java,spring,aws,docker,kubernetes&perline=6)](https://skillicons.dev)

Used Java/SpringBoot to ingest tens of millions of games from Lichess to create an opening recomendation system for beginner-advanced players. Used Apache Spark, AWS Glue, S3, and ECS to create a Data Lake for the recommendation engine.

### MetaDisplay Speech Database

[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=express,nodejs,mongodb,aws,docker,kubernetes&perline=6)](https://skillicons.dev)

Collecting data from the Meta Display's to host open-source for improvement on the LLM archiecture inside the displays. 

## Some fun facts about myself:

### Chess

I love chess. I'm not the best player on earth, but I've always found it so fun. 
Chess really helped me understand many algorithims such as min-max and alpha-beta-pruning. 
It's also just so fun and relaxing, highly recommend
